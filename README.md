# Forecasting ATM Cash Demand: A Predictive Modeling Approach
This project develops a forecast function for a specific bankâ€™s cash withdrawal by utilizing characteristics of individual ATMs. After evaluating different modeling methodologies, a feed-forward neural network is chosen as the optimal model, offering the lowest MSE, mitigating multicollinearity, and reducing overfitting risk.
